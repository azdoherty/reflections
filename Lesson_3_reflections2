Manual vs automatic pull?

You may want to pull changes manually so that you aren't publishing unfinished work.

Github forking: automatically fork a repository to your own account (fork is just a github only clone).
	-It keeps track of number of people who made forks, and all link back to the original repository.
	-git remote -v : print out info about remote repository w/ verbose info.
	
Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches:
	Fork: A fork action clones a github repository on your github account. It only exists 
	in github
	Clone: A clone is created by pulling a repository from github
	Branch: A branch is created locally only when you decide your program needs to go in a different direction
