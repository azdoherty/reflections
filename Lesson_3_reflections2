Manual vs automatic pull?

You may want to pull changes manually so that you aren't publishing unfinished work.

Github forking: automatically fork a repository to your own account (fork is just a github only clone).
	-It keeps track of number of people who made forks, and all link back to the original repository.
	-git remote -v : print out info about remote repository w/ verbose info.
	
Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches:
	Fork: A fork action clones a github repository on your github account. It only exists 
	in github
	Clone: A clone is created by pulling a repository from github
	Branch: A branch is created locally only when you decide your program needs to go in a different direction
	
Merging local and remote branches:
	-Use git fetch to retain local and remote repository changes, then compare and review changes in origin
	and master. 
	-use git merge to merge when happy. (git pull accomplishes these two steps in 1 command)
	
Fast-forward merges:
	-merge 2 commits with one reachable by the other, then it just adds the commits
	
Reflect: Local copies of remote branches:
	-The benefit of having a loast known state of the remote store locally is to be able to work offline,
	or have multiple people working on the same files in parallel without continually committing to the same 
	branch.
