#Lesson 2 reflections:

Staging area: It is different from both because it does not exist anywhere, and will expire when you close git.
It offers a place to set up and review commits before applying them.
	-add to staging area: git add <arg>
	commit staging area: git commit

git checkout master restores most recent commit as current commit.

git diff compares the pwd to the staging area.

git diff --staged compares staging area to repository 

Reflection--Commit sizes:
	Ensure that there is 1 logical change per commit by comparing staging area to repository before each commit.

Branches: A non-linear commit history (good for an experimental feature or parallel path). 
	-a branch is a label for a commit. the initial one is automatically called master.
	use cmd git branch to see them, and git branch <arg> to create branch arg.
	-git checkout <arg> checks out branch
	-each commit knows its parent

	
Reflect: Why use branches: for large functional changes in a program.

Detached head message:
	-indicates you can make changes that do not effect any branches. 
	-running git checkout -b new_branch_name will turn the detached head state into a new branch.
	-it will then tell you where the head is. 
	
Reflect: How do diagrams help you understand the branch structure?
	-By visualizing the edits as a graph it makes it easy to see where you are and what you can reach
	
Merging two branches:
	-if a line appears in both branches then it is automatically included in the merge
	-for lines that are not in both we look backwards: If it is in the original but not in one branch it is deleted
		- if it is not in the original and in one branch it is kept
	the merge stores information about both of its parents. It will store all commit parents in two branches, sorted by time.
	git merge <b1> <b2> merges both branches.
	
	-git show: shows difference between commit and parent
	-can delete branch by doing git branch -d coins (after merging if you no longer need it).
	
Refect: Automatic vs manual merging: automatic merging weighs all users the same.
